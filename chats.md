### WebContainer vs VPS Architecture

**WebContainer (Current):**
- Pros: Instant boot, no server costs, works offline, great for frontend/Node.js
- Cons: Browser-only, can't run Docker/databases natively, limited to JS ecosystem

**VPS/Cloud Sandboxes (E2B, Fly.io, Modal):**
- Pros: Full Linux, any language, run databases/Docker, direct deployment
- Cons: $0.01-0.10/minute cost, cold start 2-30s, infrastructure complexity

**Recommendation: HYBRID APPROACH**
- Frontend/Node.js → WebContainer (instant, free)
- Backend/Full-stack → VPS Sandbox (on-demand)
- Databases → Managed (Supabase, PlanetScale)
- Deployment → One-click to Vercel/Netlify/Fly

### Competitive Analysis

- API Integration Library

### Recommended Feature Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Month 1-2):** Core Excellence
**Phase 2 (Month 3-4):** Mobile Dominance
**Phase 3 (Month 5-6):** Pro Features
**Phase 4 (Month 7-12):** Enterprise

| Postman | $100M+ ARR | API platform + marketplace |

### Business Models

**Model 1: Pure Marketplace (RapidAPI style)**
- Revenue = Transaction Fee (15-30%) on all API calls
- Need massive volume, chicken-egg problem

**Model 2: Infrastructure + Marketplace (Apify style)**
- Revenue = Compute/Usage + Marketplace Cut + Enterprise
- Higher margins, more complex to build

**Model 3: Vertical API Marketplace**
- Own a specific API category completely
- Less competition, higher prices

### Winning API Marketplace Ideas

1. **AI/ML Model Marketplace** - $15-50M MRR potential, 200%+ growth
2. **Data & Enrichment API Marketplace** - $10-30M MRR potential
3. **Web Scraping & Automation Marketplace** - $10-25M MRR potential
4. **Fintech/Banking API Marketplace** - $15-40M MRR potential
5. **Healthcare API Marketplace** - $10-30M MRR potential
6. **E-commerce API Marketplace** - $10-25M MRR potential
7. **Communication API Marketplace** - $10-30M MRR potential
8. **AI Agent Tool Marketplace** - $20-60M MRR potential (HOTTEST)
